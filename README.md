Parkinson's Disease Prediction Using Machine LearningThis project uses a classic machine learning approach to predict the onset of Parkinson's disease based on various vocal measurements. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on the dataset to distinguish between healthy individuals and those with Parkinson's.Project OverviewThe goal of this project is to build a reliable predictive model that can serve as an early-stage diagnostic tool for Parkinson's disease. The model analyzes a range of biomedical voice measurements and classifies whether a patient is healthy or has the disease. The final model achieves an accuracy of approximately 87% on the test data.Image of a neural network brain diagramDatasetThe dataset used in this project is the Oxford Parkinson's Disease Detection Dataset, which is publicly available. It contains 195 voice recordings from 31 individuals, of whom 23 have Parkinson's disease. Each row corresponds to one voice measurement and contains 23 different biomedical features.Features: A collection of voice measures such as fundamental frequency variations, shimmer, jitter, and noise-to-tonal ratios.Target Variable: The status column, where 1 indicates the presence of Parkinson's and 0 indicates a healthy status.Technologies and LibrariesThis project is implemented in Python 3 and relies on the following core libraries:Pandas: For data manipulation and loading the CSV file.NumPy: For numerical operations, especially for handling the input data.Scikit-learn: For the entire machine learning pipeline, including:train_test_split for splitting the data.StandardScaler for feature scaling.svm.SVC for the Support Vector Machine model.accuracy_score for model evaluation.Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and documentation.MethodologyThe project follows a standard machine learning workflow:Data Loading and Exploration: The parkinsons.csv dataset is loaded, and an initial analysis is performed to understand its structure, check for missing values, and view statistical summaries.Data Preprocessing:The features (X) and the target variable (Y) are separated. The non-informative name column is dropped.The data is split into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set.Feature Standardization is applied to scale the numerical features, ensuring that no single feature dominates the model's learning process.Model Training:A Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel is chosen as the classification algorithm.The model is trained on the standardized training data.Model Evaluation:The model's performance is evaluated by calculating the accuracy score on both the training and test datasets to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen data.Predictive System:A simple predictive system is built to demonstrate how the trained model can be used on a new set of voice measurements to make a real-time prediction.How to Run the CodeClone the repository:git clone <repository-url>
Install the required libraries:pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter
Launch Jupyter Notebook:jupyter notebook
Open and run the parkinson.ipynb notebook. Ensure that the parkinsons.csv file is in the same directory. The notebook contains the complete code from data loading to prediction, with comments explaining each step.ResultsThe SVM model achieved the following accuracy:Training Accuracy: 88.46%Test Accuracy: 87.18%The close results between the training and test accuracy indicate that the model is robust and not overfitting. It can effectively generalize its learning to make accurate predictions on new data.
